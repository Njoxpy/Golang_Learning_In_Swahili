## Variable Declaration and Initialization:

- What keyword is used to declare variables in Go?
- Explain the difference between declaration and initialization of variables.
- Provide an example of shorthand syntax for variable declaration and initialization in Go.
- Declare a variable age of type int and initialize it with the value 25.
- Declare and initialize a variable name of type string with your own name.

## Visibility:

- What is the scope of a variable in Go?
- Explain the concept of block scope and package-level scope in Go.
- In which scenarios can a variable be accessed within a Go program?
- Write a program that declares a variable x inside a function and tries to access it outside the function. What happens?
- Declare a global variable globalVar outside of any function. Access and print its value from within a different package.

## Naming Conventions:

- What naming convention does Go follon for variables, functions, and package-level identifiers?
- Why are naming conventions important in Go programming?
- Provide an example of a variable name following the camelCase convention.

## Data Types:

- Name the four basic data types in Go.
- List the variations of integer and floating-point types available in Go.
- Explain when you would use a boolean data type in a Go program.
- Declare variables of different data types (int, float64, string, bool) and assign them values. Print out the variables along with their types.
- Explore the maximum and minimum values that can be stored in different integer data types (int8, int16, int32, int64).

## Type Inference:

- What is type inference in Go?
- Contrast implicit and explicit type declaration in Go with examples.
- In which scenario would you prefer to use implicit type declaration over explicit type declaration?
- Declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type and initialize it with a numeric value. Print out its type.
- Use type inference to declare and initialize a variable with a string value.

## Type Conversion:

- What is type conversion in Go?
- Provide an example demonstrating type conversion from an integer to a float in Go.
- Explain why type conversion might be necessary in a Go program.
- Convert an int variable to a float64 and print the result.
- Convert a float64 variable to an int and print the result.
